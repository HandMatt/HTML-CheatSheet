Hello Git and GitHub! 

This is my first self directed project I have pushed to GitHub.
It is an independant project from www.codecademy.com to "Build Your Own Cheat Sheet".
I intend on updating regularly as my skills as a developer increase.
A playful design that is simple and visually pleasing (to me anyway).
Content is easy to read and digest, I have made use of www.hemmingwayapp.com in order to simplify my writting so that information is clear and concise.
